# fvcore

fvcore is a light-weight core library that provides the most common and essential
functionality shared in various computer vision frameworks developed in FAIR,
such as Detectron2. This library is based on Python 3+ and PyTorch. All the components
in this library are type-annotated, tested, and benchmarked.

The computer vision team in FAIR is responsible for maintaining this library.
